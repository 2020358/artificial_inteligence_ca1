    "Graph is a data structure composed of nodes that are connected to each other. Nodes in graphs are called Vertices and connections between them are called Edges. Graphs can be directed and undirected. *(Gibson, 2009)*  Additionally, in some graphs, edges can have weight assigned to them, that represents the cost of travelling that edge. There are multiple kinds of graphs with different properties. Graphs can have cycles and paths. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trees, on the other hand,  are a specific type of a connected graph that has no cycles. Connected means that we can traverse a tree, visiting all nodes. Trees have a single point of entry called  the root and  are hierarchical data structures that follow parent-child ordering, where each parent might have 1 or more nodes called children. Nodes without any children are called a leaf or a terminal node. *(Kumar et al, 2019)*\n",
    "### 2\n",
    "Graphs are a very powerful and useful tool to visualise many different problems from many domains. The abstraction allows us to extract problems from a specific domain. In the case of our graphs, it represents all possible ways to the destination, however in principle, it could represent different scenarios. For example, it could be a cost be the cost of the travel, or price gain between each vertex. In the case of  the latter, this could shift the purpose and objective of the game and we would probably seek a path with the most reward gained. \n",
    "### 3\n",
    "There are many advantages of using graphs to visualise a problem, such as: \n",
    "- might help people to quickly understand problem implications without understanding problem domain.\n",
    "- might help to conceptualise a solution much quicker.\n",
    "- might quickly help to identify that there is no solution to the certain problem, or that we need to try a different approach. For example, the famous 5 bridges problem and the fact you cannot travel to each island by crossing exactly each bridge once.\n",
    "- might help to identify patterns, which are impossible to visualise in form of map or list *(Scifo, 2020)*\n",

    "Dijsktraâ€™s algorithm is an algorithm created to find the shortest path in a weighted graph, where all weights are positive numbers. *(Cormen, 2009)*</br>\n",
    "This algorithm maintains a set of shortest distance to source nodes and a priority queue which holds nodes sorted by shortest working path. Then it selects nodes from the priority queue and iterates through all its neighbours, adding each to the queue. It updates the shortest path to the source if found and terminates when the queue is empty. \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "- We create a graph in a map form, where each vertex is a key and holds a list of adjacent vertices with weight assigned to them. \n",
    "- We call function with three variables, graph, source vertex, end vertex\n",
    "- Function initialises the set of shortest distance, in this implementation, shortest distance is represented by map, however, in map, there are no repeated keys, so our property holds true. \n",
    "- Distance to source is initialised to 0 and all other distances are initialised to infinity\n",
    "- Functions initialise priority queue which will hold vertices to be visited. Vertex with the smallest working  distance (distance to this vertex from source node) at the front. \n",
    "- We add source vertex to the queue\n",
    "- We enter while loop, which terminates when queue is empty, i.e. we visit all nodes \n",
    "- We dequeue vertex from the priority queue and for each neighbour and add its weight to the current working distance. \n",
    "- If we have never seen the neighbour (does not exist in our map of distances), or distance is shorter to what we have already seen, we update the shortest seen path in our map.\n",
    "- On the last step, we push all neighbours onto the priority queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we exit the while loop, we know we have seen all the vertices and hold a map of shortest distance to them from a source vertex. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can return the value of the map at the target vertex key. \n",
    "\n",
    "I found that the best way to show how the algorithm works is to add print statements to the console in crucial places, with appropriate descriptions.  \n",
