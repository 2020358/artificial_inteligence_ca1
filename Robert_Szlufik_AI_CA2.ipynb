    "Graph is a data structure composed of nodes that are connected to each other. Nodes in graphs are called Vertices and connections between them are called Edges. Graphs can be directed and undirected. *(Gibson, 2009)*  Additionally, in some graphs, edges can have weight assigned to them, that represents the cost of travelling that edge. There are multiple kinds of graphs with different properties. Graphs can have cycles and paths. \n",

    "Trees, on the other hand,  are a specific type of a connected graph that has no cycles. Connected means that we can traverse a tree, visiting all nodes. Trees have a single point of entry called  the root and  are hierarchical data structures that follow parent-child ordering, where each parent might have 1 or more nodes called children. Nodes without any children are called a leaf or a terminal node. *(Kumar et al, 2019)*\n",

    "Graphs are a very powerful and useful tool to visualise many different problems from many domains. The abstraction allows us to extract problems from a specific domain. In the case of our graphs, it represents all possible ways to the destination, however in principle, it could represent different scenarios. For example, it could be a cost be the cost of the travel, or price gain between each vertex. In the case of  the latter, this could shift the purpose and objective of the game and we would probably seek a path with the most reward gained. \n",

    "- might quickly help to identify that there is no solution to the certain problem, or that we need to try a different approach. For example, the famous 5 bridges problem and the fact you cannot travel to each island by crossing exactly each bridge once.\n",

    "### Time complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation of Dijsktra’s algorithm uses heap data structure as a priority queue, where adding and removing items is O(log n ) operation. This will be performed v times where v is the number of vertices in the graph. That gives us O(v log v). In the worst case scenario, we perform add operation at each vertex, and that gives us O ( (v+e) log v) time complexity, where v is a number of vertices and e is a number of edges. (Mcdowell, 2019) </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation of A* algorithm uses the same priority queue as Dijkstra’s algorithm implementation. A* time actually time complexity depends on heuristics and how well and accurately those are defined. In the worst case, this implemlemntation’s time complexity is the same as implementation used for Dijsktra’s algorithm. If heuristics are not set, it will traverse the entire graph in the same fashion as Dijsktra’s. Therefore, the worst case scenario time complexity is the same as above, O ( (v+e) log v) time complexity, where v is a number of vertices and e is a number of edges.\n",
    "### Actual Running Time\n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately and fairly, compare running time of both algorithms, we need to make sure that both return the same result. It would be unjust, if one algorithm returns shortest paths to all nodes or exact paths, with each intermediate node on the way, and the other just the value of the shortest path. That is why I adapted both algorithms to return the shortest path value only. I decided to do it, to achieve a more fair environment. The more operations we perform in this algorithm, the more chances that the underlying operating system will interrupt execution more, which will result in more inconsistent results. </br> \n",
    " \n",
    "It is important to mention that A* will return immediately when it finds the shortest path to the target node, where Dijksta’s will traverse the entire node before returning. This is because A* uses heuristics which will indicate the shortest path. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Code block below will run each algorithm 1000 times and calculate elapsed time between each time it starts and ends. Then, it will print averages for each algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On my machine, with current implementation A* was about 15% quicker than Dijsktra’s algorithm. "
