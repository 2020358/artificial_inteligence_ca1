    "Graph is a data structure composed of nodes that are connected to each other. Nodes in graphs are called Vertices and connections between them are called Edges. Graphs can be directed and undirected. (Gibson, 2009)  Additionally, in some graphs, edges can have weight assigned to them, that represents the cost of travelling that edge. There are multiple kinds of graphs with different properties. Graphs can have cycles and paths. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trees, on the other hand,  are a specific type of a connected graph that has no cycles. Connected means that we can traverse a tree, visiting all nodes. Trees have a single point of entry called  the root and  are hierarchical data structures that follow parent-child ordering, where each parent might have 1 or more nodes called children. Nodes without any children are called a leaf or a terminal node. (Kumar et al, 2019)\n",

    "Graphs are a very powerful and useful tool to visualise many different problems from many domains. The abstraction allows us to extract problems from a specific domain. In the case of our graphs, it represents all possible ways to the destination, however in principle, it could represent different scenarios. For example, it could be a cost be the cost of the travel, or price gain between each vertex. In the case of  the latter, this could shift the purpose and objective of the game and we would probably seek a path with the most reward gained. \n",

    "There are many advantages of using graphs to visualise a problem, such as: \n",
    "- might help people to quickly understand problem implications without understanding problem domain.\n",
    "- might help to conceptualise a solution much quicker.\n",
    "- might quickly help to identify that there is no solution to the certain problem, or that we need to try a different approach. For example, the famous 5 bridges problem and the fact you cannot travel to each island by crossing exactly each bridge once.\n",
    "- might help to identify patterns, which are impossible to visualise in form of map or list (Scifo, 2020)\n",
